+
+  On the last working day of each week, the online SYSLOG is dumped to
+ a permanent archival tape using SYSLOG primary menu option DW. Option
+ DW (Dump Weekly) prompts for the Quarter and Year containing the SYSLOG
+ to be dumped.  As an archival tape is closed-out at the end of a quarter,
+ the last day represented on the tape should be written externally on
+ this tape.  Selection of the end-of-quarter dump precludes weekly dumps.
+ If the end-of-quarter falls on a day other than the last working day of
+ the week, it is acceptable to run the Dump Weekly procedure on this day so as
+ to close out the quarter. In other words, it is possible to run the Dump
+ Weekly procedure twice during an end-of-quarter week, once to end the quarter
+ and another to end the week.
+  It is imperative that the ending date be written externally on the tape
+ so that the date range on a given quarterly tape can be readily determined.
+ Input parameters required for the Dump Weekly function are described below.
