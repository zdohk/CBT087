%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+ The EXCEPTION option  submits a batch JOB that will search either the  weekly
+ online SYSLOG or a quarterly SYSLOG archive tape. The SYSLOG period request-
+ ed will be searched for specific 'exception' events and a report will be
+ generated that will be sorted by event type.  Contact Mark Diehl if there are
+ additional exception events to be added to this report. The output produced
+ by this JOB can be viewed using ISPF option 3.8. After viewing, either
+ print (using 3.8 option 'P') or delete (using option 'D') this output.  Each
+ report line will contain a 5-character event-ID, followed by a 3-digit julian
+ date, followed by the time-of-day, followed by the actual text of the SYSLOG
+ record itself.
+
+ Report Period options available on the EXCEPTION REPORT menu are:
+
+   %C - Current Week's SYSLOG+ - submits batch JOB directly. The report pro-
+                                 duced by selecting this option is also pro-
+                                 duced automatically by the weekly 'DW' option
+
+   %A - Archived SYSLOG (from quarterly tape)+ - requests the user to supply
+                                                 report period, then submits
+                                                 a batch JOB.
