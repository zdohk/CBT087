+An EXCEPTION report can be generated using an entire quarter's SYSLOG as input.
+This report can be quite voluminous so care should be taken to view the output
+via the SPF 3.8 OUTLIST utility before printing.  This JOB is also run by oper-
+ations at the closing-out of a quarterly SYSLOG tape. Output is kept on file
+with the quarterly tape for one year. Input to this option is described below.
